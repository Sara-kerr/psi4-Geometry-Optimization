# Water Molecule Geometry Optimization Using Psi4 lib

This project performs a geometry optimization calculation for a water molecule (Hâ‚‚O) using different functionals and basis sets. The code allows for easy comparison of the optimized energy, O-H bond lengths, and H-O-H bond angle for various configurations.

## Project Setup

To run this project, you need to have [Psi4](http://www.psicode.org/) installed. Psi4 is a quantum chemistry package used to perform electronic structure calculations.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Psi4
- Optional: Docker (if you prefer running Psi4 in a containerized environment)
